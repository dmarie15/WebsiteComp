    height="170px"
    width="150px">
    <th> A small-to-medium breed of short-haired cat. Similar to <br> the Arabian Mau, they are quite vocal cats, often with <br>
      beautiful markings. They are friendly, and the fastest of <br> all domestic cats. Lifespan is often shortened by a tendency for <br>
      gingivitis and liver problems but can be as long as any other cat. </th>

  <th> British Longhair </th>
  <th> <img src="image/cat6.jpg" alt="British Longhair Image"
    height="150px"
    width="150px">
    <th> The British Longhair is a longer-haired development from <br> cross-breeding with the British Shorthair. They can be prone <br>
     to obesity if neutered or kept as indoor cats, and are at a <br> higher risk of kidney disease. They shed a lot if not brushed, <br>
     but are very friendly. Lifespan 12-13 years.
